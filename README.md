# To-Do List Application - CRUD Project

Dear Md. Shakirul Islam,

Congratulations on being shortlisted for the position of "Software Development Intern (Laravel PHP)"! As part of the next step in the selection process, you are required to develop a simple to-do list application using Laravel. Below are the instructions and guidelines for this task.

## Project Description

This project is a simple to-do list application that allows users to create, read, update, and delete tasks. The application is built using Laravel and uses a SQLite database for simplicity. 

## Features

- Users can create tasks with a title and a description.
- Users can mark tasks as completed or incomplete.
- Users can edit and delete tasks.
- Input fields are validated to ensure data integrity (e.g., title should not be empty, description is optional).
- Tasks are displayed in a list with their titles and statuses (completed/incomplete).
- Basic styling is applied to distinguish between completed and incomplete tasks.

## Requirements

- Use Laravel (latest stable version).
- Use a SQLite database.
- Follow Laravelâ€™s best practices and coding standards.
- Include comments in the code where necessary to explain the logic.

## Database Schema

Each task should have the following fields:

- `Title`: string, required
- `Description`: text, optional
- `Status`: boolean, completed (true) or incomplete (false)
- `Timestamps`: created_at and updated_at

## Environment Setup

### Prerequisites

- PHP >= 7.4
- Composer
- SQLite
- Git

### Steps to Set Up the Development Environment

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/todo-list.git
   cd todo-list
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   composer install
   ```

3. **Create a copy of the `.env` file:**

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

4. **Update the `.env` file with the following database configuration:**

   ```env
   DB_CONNECTION=sqlite
   DB_DATABASE=/path/to/your/database/database.sqlite
   ```

   Ensure the specified path exists and the `database.sqlite` file is created. You can create the file using:

   ```bash
   touch database/database.sqlite
   ```

5. **Generate the application key:**

   ```bash
   php artisan key:generate
   ```

6. **Run the migrations to set up the database schema:**

   ```bash
   php artisan migrate
   ```

### Instructions to Run the Application

1. **Start the development server:**

   ```bash
   php artisan serve
   ```

2. **Open your browser and navigate to:**

   ```
   http://localhost:8000
